# funofbooks-server

## About

This project uses [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com).

It provides a full REST API to my [funofbooks-webapp](https://github.com/lantos14/funofbooks-webapp), with a live connection to a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database.

Also I added authentication, and deployed it to [Google Cloud Service](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) App Engine.

Feel free to browse. :)
